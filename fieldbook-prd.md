|-----------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| FR001          | User Authentication       | As a contractor, I want to securely log into the system so that only I can access sensitive payroll and employee data. | The system should provide a secure login screen with username/password authentication and remember login status for convenience. |
| FR002          | Employee Management       | As a contractor, I want to add new employees with their basic details so I can manage my workforce effectively. | The system should provide a form to add employee name, base wage rate, contact information, and employment status with validation for required fields. |
| FR003          | Employee List View        | As a contractor, I want to see a list of all my employees so I can quickly access their information and current status. | The system should display a scrollable list of employees showing name, current status (active/inactive), and quick action buttons for common tasks. |
| FR004          | Daily Attendance Tracking | As a contractor, I want to record complete daily attendance information for each employee so I can track all work-related data in one place. | The system should provide a comprehensive daily attendance form including: present/absent status, construction site assignment, work multiplier (0.5x to 2x), advance payments given, and extra payments (transportation, materials, etc.). |
| FR005          | Construction Site Management | As a contractor, I want to create and manage construction sites so I can track which employees work at which locations. | The system should allow creation of site records with name, start date, and status, and provide assignment of employees to specific sites. |
| FR006          | Site Assignment Tracking  | As a contractor, I want to assign employees to specific construction sites so I can track labor distribution and site costs. | The system should provide a way to assign employees to sites for specific days and track historical site assignments for reporting. |
| FR007          | Variable Wage Calculation | As a contractor, I want the system to automatically calculate daily wages based on base wage and work multiplier so I don't make calculation errors. | The system should automatically compute daily wage as: base wage Ã— multiplier, and display calculated amounts clearly. |
| FR008          | Advance Payment Integration | As a contractor, I want to record advance payments as part of daily attendance so I can track them contextually with work performed. | The system should allow recording advance payments during daily attendance entry and automatically update employee advance balance tracking. |
| FR009          | Daily Expense Integration | As a contractor, I want to record additional daily expenses during attendance entry so I can capture all employee-related costs in one workflow. | The system should allow recording of additional expenses (transport, materials, etc.) as part of the daily attendance process and categorize them appropriately. |
| FR010          | Weekly Settlement Calculation | As a contractor, I want to see weekly payment summaries for each employee so I can settle wages every Tuesday. | The system should generate weekly reports showing total wages earned, advances to be deducted, additional expenses, and net payment due for each employee. |
| FR011          | Payment History Tracking  | As a contractor, I want to view payment history for each employee so I can resolve disputes and track payment patterns. | The system should maintain a complete payment history showing dates, amounts, types (wage/advance/expense), and settlement status for each transaction. |
| FR012          | Dashboard Overview        | As a contractor, I want to see a summary dashboard so I can quickly understand my current financial obligations and workforce status. | The system should display total pending wages, number of active employees, upcoming settlement amounts, and recent activity in an easy-to-read format. |
| FR013          | Employee Status Management | As a contractor, I want to activate/deactivate employees so I can manage workforce changes without deleting historical data. | The system should allow toggling employee active status and filter views to show only active employees while preserving all historical records. |
| FR014          | Site Financial Tracking   | As a contractor, I want to track total money withdrawn for each construction site so I can monitor project costs. | The system should maintain running totals of all payments associated with each site and display site-wise financial summaries. |
| FR015          | Offline Data Support      | As a contractor, I want to access and update data even without internet connection so I can work on construction sites with poor connectivity. | The system should cache essential data locally and sync changes when connectivity is restored, with clear indicators of sync status. |
| FR016          | Data Backup and Sync      | As a contractor, I want my data to be automatically backed up so I don't lose important payroll information. | The system should automatically sync data to cloud storage and provide data recovery options in case of device loss or failure. |
| FR017          | Quick Attendance Entry    | As a contractor, I want to quickly mark attendance for multiple employees so I can efficiently manage daily check-ins. | The system should provide a streamlined interface to mark attendance for multiple employees simultaneously with default values and quick action buttons. |
| FR018          | Settlement Report Generation | As a contractor, I want to generate printable/shareable settlement reports so I can provide payment summaries to employees. | The system should generate formatted reports showing weekly breakdowns that can be viewed, printed, or shared digitally with employees. |
| FR019          | Search and Filter Employees | As a contractor, I want to search and filter employees so I can quickly find specific individuals in my workforce. | The system should provide search functionality by name and filtering options by status, site assignment, or payment status. |
| FR020          | Mobile-First Interface    | As a contractor, I want the interface to work seamlessly on my mobile phone so I can manage operations while on job sites. | The system should be optimized for mobile screens with touch-friendly controls, readable fonts, and efficient navigation suitable for one-handed operation. |
