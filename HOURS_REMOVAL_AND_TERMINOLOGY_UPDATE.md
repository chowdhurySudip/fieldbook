# Hours Worked Removal & Session-to-Location Terminology Update

## Overview
Removed hours worked from wage calculations and UI, and changed terminology from "work sessions" to "work locations" throughout the application for clearer understanding of the multi-location work feature.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Wage Calculation Simplification**

#### **Before (Hours-based)**:
```typescript
// Proportional calculation based on 8-hour day
sessionWage * (hoursWorked / 8)
```

#### **After (Multiplier-based)**:
```typescript
// Direct multiplier-based calculation
baseWage * workMultiplier
```

#### **Example**:
- **Employee**: Base wage ₹400/day
- **Working 2 locations**: Site A (0.5x), Site B (0.5x)
- **Total wage**: (₹400 × 0.5) + (₹400 × 0.5) = ₹400

### 2. **Data Structure Updates**

#### **WorkSession Interface**:
```typescript
// REMOVED: hoursWorked field
type WorkSession = {
  id: string;
  siteId: string;
  workMultiplier: number;
  // hoursWorked: number; // ❌ Removed
};
```

#### **Attendance Record Storage**:
- Hours field kept at default `8` for backwards compatibility
- Calculations no longer use hours value
- Wage calculation purely based on multipliers

### 3. **UI Changes**

#### **Attendance Entry Page**:
- ❌ **Removed**: "Hours Worked" input field
- ❌ **Removed**: "Total Hours" from wage summary
- ✅ **Changed**: "Work Sessions" → "Work Locations"
- ✅ **Changed**: "Session 1, Session 2" → "Location 1, Location 2"
- ✅ **Changed**: "No work sessions added" → "No work locations added"

#### **Employee History Page**:
- ✅ **Changed**: Interface from `sessions` to `locations`
- ✅ **Updated**: Rendering logic to use `item.locations`
- ✅ **Maintained**: Tabular display structure

#### **Collapsible Cards**:
- ✅ **Updated**: Summary text from "2 sessions • 8h total" → "2 locations"
- ✅ **Updated**: Status indicators to reflect locations instead of sessions

### 4. **Terminology Consistency**

#### **UI Text Updates**:
| Old Text | New Text |
|----------|----------|
| "Work Sessions" | "Work Locations" |
| "Session 1" | "Location 1" |
| "2 sessions" | "2 locations" |
| "No work sessions added" | "No work locations added" |
| "Missing work session" | "Missing work location" |
| "Select a site for all work sessions" | "Select a site for all work locations" |

### 5. **Functional Impact**

#### **Wage Calculation Logic**:
- **Simplified**: No need for proportional hour calculations
- **Direct**: Each location contributes its full multiplier-based wage
- **Intuitive**: Easier to understand (0.5x + 0.5x = 1.0x total)

#### **Multi-Location Support**:
- **Enhanced Clarity**: "Locations" better describes the concept than "sessions"
- **User Understanding**: Clearer that employees work at different physical locations
- **Business Logic**: Aligns with the reality of construction work across sites

### 6. **Backward Compatibility**

#### **Data Migration**:
- ✅ **Existing Records**: `hoursWorked` field preserved in database
- ✅ **Loading Logic**: Hours ignored in calculations but data intact
- ✅ **New Records**: Default to 8 hours for compatibility

#### **Settlement Calculations**:
- ✅ **Weekly Settlements**: Continue to work with simplified wage calculations
- ✅ **Payment History**: Maintains existing data structure
- ✅ **Reporting**: No impact on existing reports

## Benefits

### 1. **Simplified User Experience**:
- ❌ **No More**: Complex hour tracking and proportional calculations
- ✅ **Clearer**: Direct multiplier-based wage understanding
- ✅ **Faster**: Quicker attendance entry without hour input

### 2. **Better Business Logic**:
- ✅ **Realistic**: Reflects actual construction work patterns
- ✅ **Flexible**: Easy to adjust wages per location with multipliers
- ✅ **Scalable**: Can easily add more locations without complexity

### 3. **Improved Terminology**:
- ✅ **Intuitive**: "Locations" clearer than "sessions"
- ✅ **Professional**: Better aligns with construction industry language
- ✅ **Consistent**: Unified terminology across the app

## Usage Examples

### **Single Location Work**:
```
Employee: John
Base Wage: ₹500/day
Location 1: Site A (1.0x multiplier)
Total Wage: ₹500 × 1.0 = ₹500
```

### **Multi-Location Work**:
```
Employee: John
Base Wage: ₹500/day
Location 1: Site A (0.5x multiplier) = ₹250
Location 2: Site B (0.5x multiplier) = ₹250
Total Wage: ₹250 + ₹250 = ₹500
```

### **Overtime/Special Work**:
```
Employee: John
Base Wage: ₹500/day
Location 1: Site A (1.5x multiplier) = ₹750
Location 2: Site B (0.5x multiplier) = ₹250
Total Wage: ₹750 + ₹250 = ₹1,000
```

This update significantly simplifies the wage calculation system while making the multi-location feature more intuitive and aligned with construction industry practices.
